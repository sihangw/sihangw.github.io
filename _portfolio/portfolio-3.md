Formulated the problem of synchronization and obstacle avoidance of Multi-Agent System over a directed graph subject to communication link faults.

Leveraged observer-based controller scheme with linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and model predictive control (MPC). Explored Control Lyapunov Function and Control Barrier Function (CBF-CLF) based method for obstacle avoidance of leader and follower agents

Adopted a distributed resilient state estimation method upon which we present our own control protocols to address the communication link faults.
